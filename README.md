# river_output_switcher

This script allows to automagically focus the output pointed with the mouse pointer. This provides an imperfect 
(and hopefully temporary) workaround to this issue: https://github.com/riverwm/river/issues/448. For the script to work,
you need to apply the pending (as for Nov 25th, 2021) pull request first: https://github.com/riverwm/river/pull/475.
You also need to set `focus-follows-cursor normal` in the river ini file.

This is the very first version. It may need some further work, but seems to do the job.
